# Possibilities-Data

Problem Statement Identified as to Design and Develop a Machine Learning system to determine relevant products for a store based on its past transaction history. These suggestions can be used in multiple sales channels to the store like self ordering app, sales executive PDA or by a calling agent to ensure that store is not missing out on any of these relevant products.

Project Objective

The Intent and Motive of Project is deals with price recommendation for marketplace sellers. One of the biggest promises of in selecting machine learning is to automate decision making in a multitude of domains. At the core of many data-driven personalized decision scenarios is the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects: what is the causal effect of an intervention on an outcome of interest for a sample with a particular set of features?

Such questions arise frequently in customer segmentation in details as follows what is the effect of placing a customer in a tier over another tier, dynamic pricing what is the effect of a pricing policy on demand and In many such settings we have an abundance of observational data,

Example Applications

Customer Targeting

Businesses offer personalized incentives to customers to increase sales and level of engagement. Any such personalized intervention corresponds to a monetary investment and the main question that business analytics are called to answer is: what is the return on investment? Analyzing the ROI is inherently a treatment effect question: what was the effect of any investment on a customer's spend? Understanding how ROI varies across customers can enable more targeted investment policies and increased ROI via better targeting.

Personalized Pricing

Personalized discounts have are widespread in the digital economy. To set the optimal personalized discount policy a business needs to understand what is the effect of a drop in price on the demand of a customer for a product as a function of customer characteristics. The estimation of such personalized demand elasticities can also be phrased in the language of heterogeneous treatment effects, where the treatment is the price on the demand as a function of observable features of the customer.
